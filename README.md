Recreated old hackathon project that was a clone of /r/place, but with Minecraft inspired features like binary logic blocks and other stuff. It kinda worked but we ran out of time, and I think it deserves to be done properly. Currently those are not yet re-implemented, so this is basically just /r/place in swift with Google oauth at the moment. 

I intend to eventually replace my website homepage with this if I get around to finishing it.
